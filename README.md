we created a gamified learning
platform where 
learning can be made fun to users
. its having a captivating,
interactive and user-friendly 
approach. The entire learning process
is gamified in our platform. 
we believe teachers should use our 
approach and method instead of
sending online pdfs, so that students will
find it more intriguing and thus 
perform better. To begin with learning 
various tutorials in which we took 
example of studying about 
solar system, is like completing
LEVEL 1. we added captivating,
alluring stuff like rotating planets 
to grab students' attention and interest. 
then LEVEL 2 is like a challenge to
complete, where one has to test
their learning till the previous chapter(tutorial) 
and score points (like you do in games), 
and we used MACHINE LEARNING 
to predict the student's scores in institution considering his performance in our platform's test, by analyzing and studying data of peers using the same platform to study and take test in our platform. Also at last we have added a leader board in the end, where a competitive gaming atmosphere can motivate students to perform better than others by each trying to work harder then before. convert this paragraph into points
